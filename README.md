## Notes about the refresh token

    The refresh_token is only provided on the first authorization from the user. Subsequent authorizations, such as the kind you make while testing an OAuth2 integration, will not return the refresh_token again. :)
1. Go to your account security settings: https://www.google.com/settings/u/1/security.
2. Click the edit button next to "Authorizing applications and sites"
3. Then click "Revoke Access" next to your app.  
4. The next OAuth2 request you make will return a refresh_token.
